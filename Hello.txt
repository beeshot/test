hello
Since 2019 the Blockchain Research Lab is part of the Institute for Internet Security if(is) headed by Prof. Dr. (TU NN) Norbert Pohlmann. The international and interdisciplinary research team has a diverse skill set to deliver high quality research and enable industry partners to use blockchain in a secure and contemporary manner. Our research is fundamental, aimed for evaluation of blockchain technologies, implementation and uses cases across private, governmental and organizational level. The research includes context analysis for certain scenarios or technologies, empirical research (deploying, testing, evaluation), literature research and analysis. The goal is always to create or validate safe & secure concepts with different blockchain technologies which are in compliance with current data privacy guidelines and the GDPR. We are the competence center for Blockchain and try to establish blockchain technologies as enablers of new business models and efficient business processes. Blockchain technology as a collaboration tool. The blockchain technology generates an encrypted chain of networked data blocks. In these tamper-proof, lalalaa and redundant data structures, all transactions in the time sequence are logically traceable, immutable and mapped without a central instance.
